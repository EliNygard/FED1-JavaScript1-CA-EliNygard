Desktop:
Dropdown - line number 2 with categories. Links on all categories. Klarer ikke å få den ned på ny linje.
Horror: hover on film - darker transition 
Checkout: Move button Back to left side

Mobile:



All:
Header much taller. Create new gradient on website?
Space before footer


NOT WORKING PERFECTLY:
Button in banner when scaling down. Moves. Landed on % instead of rem.
Grid on horror page. 2 columns with too much gap


/*buttons.css*/
gather styles in cta, make adjustment to the others
- adjust classes cta cta-mobile osv
- do i even use cta-mobile -desktop?


/*home*/
Place button
Dropdown: set max width, size osv
Remove scroll line?


/*header*/
[Navigation: I created two, couldn't figure out if it was possible with one and design them for mobile/desktop - hence they are a bit different.] 
Gratient smoother
Dropdown on desktop: new line on dropdown
name change: section --> div. because there is no h1 in the header



/*filmlist*/
How can the gap stay the same when moving between screen sizes?
                            

/*film page*/
(Find new icons)
større font på details
cast/crew use h2
name change: section --> div. because there is no h1 in the header
 
/*footer**/
greate grid and flex elements
do I need nav element before div?


/*buttons*/
low contrast pink/white. darker pink?
